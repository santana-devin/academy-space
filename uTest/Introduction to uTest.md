# What is Software Testing?
https://youtu.be/54dbm7DMNso?rel=0


## What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process in which the features and functionalities of a product are evaluated with the intent of locating all defects and errors within the product.


## Why is Software Testing important?
Software testing helps to identify the defects and errors that were made during the development phases of a product. Software testing enables developers to produce high quality products for their users that are free from defects in the features, functionalities and process flows of the product.


## What is a Software Tester?
A software tester is a person that uses and evaluates a product to identify the defects and errors within the product.


## What is Crowdtesting?
Crowdtesting is when a group of people test the same product in real world scenarios to provide insights and feedback about the product.

Millions of people across the globe can download the same app and have entirely unique experiences. There are hundreds of variables that could lead one person to have a positive user experience where another would have a less than ideal one. Differences such as devices and software, physical locations, user demographics, and level of tech savviness could all lend to wildly different digital experiences.

Traditional testing methodologies are no longer sufficient in today's ever changing, ever growing, digital landscape. Even the most advanced in-house QA departments are ultimately restricted in what they are able to test, and can not account for real-world complexities users face on a daily basis. The solution? Crowdtesting.

uTest is the pioneer and leader of In-the-Wild Crowdtesting since 2007. At uTest, we believe that only real people, using real devices, in real locations, under real world scenarios, are able to provide our customers with the authentic user insights required to build the very best digital experiences. Everyday across the globe uTest testers are paid to provide digital testing, payment testing, and omnichannel feedback, to the world’s leading brands. Giving invaluable visibility into how their technology works in the hands of their users.

The uTest Community is made up of people from all over the world with distinct backgrounds, interests, skills, and professions. The diversity of our testers is just one of the many reasons uTest is so successful.

uTest has specialized in Crowdtesting since 2007.

## Testing Team:  
**Client or Customer**	A company that has engaged Applause and the uTest Community to test their product.

**TTL**	The Test Team Lead (TTL) is the primary point of contact for testers. The TTL helps testers within test cycles and reviews all submitted bug reports and test cases, etc.

**TE**	The Test Engineer (TE) builds the test cycle, assembles the testing team and is responsible for the overall execution of the test cycle. Also, the TE is responsible for marshalling the test team through completion of the test cycle achieving the goals of the request.

**TSM**	Test Architect (TA) title has been replaced by Testing Services Manager (TSM). The TSM works directly with the client. They manage a team of TTLs and TEs to identify and provide appropriate solutions for the client’s testing, feedback or research needs.

**SDM**	The Solution Delivery Manager (SDM) is the customer’s primary point of contact, and works with the customer directly.

**CM**	The Community Management (CM) team are members of the Community Management Team. The Community Management Team's goal is to help our global community to learn how to be excellent testers, to get opportunities for paid projects, and to connect with fellow testers across the community and the globe. Meet the uTest Community Management team from here.

**CE**	Community Engineers are members who work closely with the CM team and help with their tasks and responsibility.

**DT**	The Dedicated Testers’ function is to provide the team with speed, specialized expertise, and quality control. This role differs from the traditional role of our community testers and they are supposed to have a singular focus and dive deep. These testers should be seen as experts by their community peers and help support the TTL in chat management as an expert. Testers who have a strong history of quality work are more likely to be approached by a TSM/TE to ask about becoming a DT.

## **Test Cycle Terms:**  
**Project Or Test Cycle**	One specific test of a company's product. Each individual test cycle includes numerous testers and can vary greatly from other test cycles depending on the cycle setting, type, etc. In the test cycle, testers must carefully follow the instructions in the test cycle's overview to find bugs on the in scope product, execute test cases, submit reviews, or conduct usability studies, if available.

**Test Case**	A Test Case is a set of predefined steps that must be followed and executed by a tester in order to test specific features and functionalities of a product, such as exercising a particular program path or verifying compliance with a specific requirement.

**Slot**	A slot is a reserved position within a test cycle for a tester with specific requirements such as location, device, OS, etc. A slot may or may not be linked to test cases, if a slot is not linked to a test case it is referred to as an Exploratory slot which means a tester can freely test the product and report bugs that are found and are within the in scope areas.

**Issue/Bug report**	Is a written summary of a specific error or defect (bug) in a product's features or functionality. A bug report should contain all the required information to understand, reproduce, and fix the bug.

## **Testing Types:**  

**Fn - Functional**	Testing the features/functionality of a product with the intent of locating issues.  

**Ln - Localization**	Verify the quality of a product in terms of a particular target culture/locale.  

**Ux - Usability**	Measures how easy to use and user-friendly a product is by testing it with real users.

**Voice testing**	Testing voice-enabled products with native speakers. It combines functional testing, dialogue verification, usability testing, and payment testing to help companies deliver voice experiences that foster ongoing customer engagement and satisfaction.

**Bug Hunt Testing***	This is a robust exploratory test. The goal of this kind of testing is to only find out a specific bug or a specific bug on a specific device or specific type of bug that occurs within the testing scope. Testers invited to this cycle should carefully read and understand the overview and the requirements and they must avoid reporting issues that are not in scope.

**On-site testing**	Visiting a physical location to evaluate the quality of the service and collect feedback.

**Live Testing**	Testing at a specific time, testers must perform testing at that time, they cannot be late or test earlier.

**ET - Exploratory Testing**	Exploratory Testing is a simultaneous activity of learning, test design, and test execution. In other words, the tester is designing their tests and executing them at the same time. As an exploratory tester, your next action (the next test) is influenced by your previous actions, your observations of the product’s behavior, and your own thought process. The key aspect of Exploratory Testing is not the test technique being used or the product being tested, but the skills and experience of individual testers.

## **uTest Terms:**

**SRS - Special Requirement Survey**	Is a tool that is widely used by Testing Services and Community Management to recruit testers for test cycles where data points are needed that the platform doesn’t capture yet.

**KI - Known Issue**	Known Issues are the issues that are already been found in previous Test Cycles or the issues that the customer already knows about. Known issues are helpful to prevent duplicate submissions, and in order to avoid rejections, testers should always check them before starting testing. The known issues can be added in the Cycle in sort of a spreadsheet or you can recognize them by seeing a blue “bookmark” tag next to the issue to indicate that this is a Known Issue in the title column of the issues page.

**BFV - Bug Fix Verification**	Is a process of verifying if a reported bug has been fixed when a fix or a new build for the product is released. Applause allows customers to run a re-test once a new build with fixes for those bugs is available, effectively verifying that the bug has been fixed.

**NDA - Non Disclosure Agreement**	Which is a binding contract between Tester and Applause App Quality, and by signing the NDA the tester agrees not to disclose any information covered by the agreement. Typically used to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information.

**IR - Info Request**	More information is requested on a bug report or test case, or a tester is required to fix the bug report or test case.

**Environment**	Refers to device, OS, OS version, browser, or any specific setup that is used for testing.

**Triage/Triaging**	A process of reviewing a bug report or test case and then sending an info request or recommending the bug report or the test case for approval or rejection.

**Placeholder**	A placeholder is a submitted bug report without complete information or required attachments for the purpose of reserving the position of the report and later on edit and completing the report or changing it to a different bug.

**Reproduction**	Is the process of recreating a bug by following the action performed steps in a bug report.

**Turnaround Time**	This is the time limit when testing work should be submitted. For example, a slot or test case with a turnaround time of 6 hours should be submitted within 6 hours after claiming the slot or test case.

### Bug Rejection Types:  

**WAD - Working As Designed**	Work as designed is a rejection where the reported issue is working as designed, meaning that the behavior is exactly how the product is designed to work.

**DUP - Duplicate issue**	A duplicate rejection is a rejection where the bug reported is already reported by another tester or is a Known Issue that is added to the cycle.

**OOS - Out Of Scope**	An Out of Scope rejection is a rejection where the reported bug is not in the scope of the testing product, for example only certain areas of the website are being tested in the cycle and any other areas should not be tested, reporting a bug that is found in one of these areas that are not in the scope of the cycle will be categorized as Out of Scope, the same case applies if the issue was found in a product that was not being tested like an external website.

**DNFI - Did Not Follow Instructions**	Can be used when the tester ignored clear instructions which affected the outcome or made the report unusable.

**INF - Need more info**	A tester did not provide the requested information to the bug report when an info request was sent.

**Other**	All rejection reasons should be covered by using the above ones. In case the customer has a different reason for rejection, they might use Other.

### Bug Approval Types:

**Somewhat Valuable**	The bug has some impact on the product and has some value to the customer.

**Very Valuable**	The bug has a significant impact on the product and very valuable to the customer.

**Exceptionally Valuable**	The bug has a critical impact on the product and must be fixed. These bugs bring exceptional value to the customer.
